\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Project Title}
\textbf{MongoDB Implementation of a Chat Application Schema}

\subsection{Goal of the Project}
This project explores MongoDB as a document-oriented NoSQL database solution.
We migrate and analyze a chat application database schema originally designed for relational databases to demonstrate MongoDB's capabilities, advantages, and use cases.

\subsection{Context}
The course deliverables are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A recorded presentation / movie about MongoDB.
  \item An eBook chapter covering MongoDB concepts, design, installation, examples, and evaluation.
  \item A MongoDB implementation of the migrated schema (plus a relational baseline for comparison).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope and Deliverables}
The project implements the database of a chat application with the following logical entities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Users}: user accounts and authentication data
  \item \textbf{Groups}: chat groups / channels
  \item \textbf{Group Members}: relationship between users and groups
  \item \textbf{Chat Messages}: messages sent within groups
  \item \textbf{Files}: file attachments shared in conversations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baseline and Target Data Model}
Figure~\ref{fig:rel_schema} shows the relational schema used as baseline. Figure~\ref{fig:mongo_schema} shows the derived MongoDB schema / collection design.
